# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project from the Foundation Phase encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project I will be linking from a homepage to my favourite recipes online. I will be demonstrating my skills of working with various html tags, especially the anchor tag, the image tags, and the list elements.
