# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project from the Foundation Phase encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project will be testing the HTML and CSS skills that I obtained thus far at this level. 

It contains a homepage with a list linking to my all-time favourite salad recipes. All the recipes on this prject are referenced from www.allrecipes.com.
